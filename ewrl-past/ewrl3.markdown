New! line #41express is direct from train station to the Campus (week days).  
Departures: 7h34, 7h45, 8h03 and 8h15.  
Back to train sation (“INSA” bus stop): 16h05, 16h42, 17h10, 17h48, 18h08 and 18h08.

From “Place de la Mairie” take bus #6 and get off at “Tournebride” bus stop; then take bus #16 (or #40Ex, #41Ex, #16Ex) and get off at “INSA”.

From city center, take bus #16 or #40Ex from “Republique” or “Pont Pasteur”.

From INSA bus stop, follow the arrows !!

Announcement
------------

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a growing research area within the machine learning community. To try to build an European community of people working in reinforcement learning, and to give visibility to the current situation in the old continent, we are running a now biennal series of workshops. EWRL-3 will take place this year (1997) in Rennes, France The first two editions of the workshop took place in 1994 in Brussels, Belgium (EWRL-1, the First European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning), and in 1995 in Milano, Italy ([EWRL-2](http://web.archive.org/web/20070624153319/http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~ewrl/EWRL2/EWRL2.html), the Second European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning). The two-day workshop will be organized as follows. The first morning will be opened by a plenary talk given by [Andrew Moore](http://web.archive.org/web/20070624153319/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/hp.html).

The rest of the workshop will be dedicated to presentations given by selected workshop participants. The length of presentations will be decided after we have some feedback on the number of participants.

The workshop will be restricted to researchers active in the field and to their students.

An inscription fee of FF 1,000 (roughly $170 at current change) will cover local organization expenses, coffee breaks, and a social dinner on Monday evening.

Please communicate ASAP your intention to participate by means of the intention form below (e-mail is preferred: mdorigo@ulb.ac.be).  
Otherwise send intention forms to: Marco Dorigo, IRIDIA, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Avenue Franklin Roosvelt 50, CP 194/6, 1050 Bruxelles, Belgium.
