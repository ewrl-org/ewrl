### Description

The European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning is the gathering hub of the RL research community in Europe and one of the main world-class events in RL. We plan to make the 2024 edition an exciting event for researchers worldwide, both for the presentation of top quality papers, but also as a forum for ample discussion of open problems and future research directions.

### Topics

Reinforcement learning is an active field of research which deals with the problem of sequential decision making in unknown (and often) stochastic and/or partially observable environments. Recently there has been a wealth of impressive empirical results, including those coupling Deep Learning function approximators with Reinforcement Learning algorithms, as well as significant theoretical advances. Both types of advances are of major importance and we aim to create a forum to discuss such interesting results, their applications, consequences, and research perspectives.

The workshop will cover a range of sub-topics including, but not limited to (click to expand):

*   MDPs and Dynamic Programming
*   Temporal Difference Methods
*   Policy Optimization
*   Model-based RL and Planning
*   Exploration in RL
*   Offline RL
*   Unsupervised and Intrinsically Motivated RL
*   Representation Learning in RL
*   Lifelong and Non-stationary RL
*   Hierarchical RL
*   Partially observable RL
*   Multi-agent RL
*   Multi-objective RL
*   Transfer and Meta RL
*   Deep RL
*   Imitation Learning and Inverse RL
*   Risk-sensitive and robust RL
*   Theoretical aspects of RL
*   Empirical evaluations, applications and real-life RL

### Workshop Venue, accommodation and transportation

EWRL17 will be held at Université Toulouse 1 Capitole, in the (beautiful) [Arsenal Campus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ytWwTWpsPbpiefVa7). The campus is located at the heart of the lively city of Toulouse, in South-West France.

If you arrive by [train](https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/) at [Matabiau station](https://g.co/kgs/VQ4znTj) or the [bus station](https://g.co/kgs/Hk5prMF), the [bus/metro](https://www.tisseo.fr/en) will take you to [Place du Capitole](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8V1bBkudWwVxE726). It is the [second stop](https://metro-toulouse.com/ligne-A-metro-toulouse.php) after the SNCF station in the direction of Basso Cambo. There are two metro lines in Toulouse. A single metro ticket costs 1.60 Euros. You can buy it at the metro entrance.

If you arrive by car, opt for the western ring road, exit [Ponts Jumeaux-Amidonniers (exit 30)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bchrirYRrvTQwiiV7). It is quite difficult to park in the city center. The university parking lot is reserved for university staff and professors. However, there is a paid underground parking lot ([Parking Arnaud Bernard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/egSVJiVe7TXzC98Y9)) a 5-minute walk from the university.

If you arrive by [plane](https://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/en), you will fly over the city center before landing. If you are lucky, you will see why Toulouse is called the pink city. At the airport, shuttle buses provide transfers between the airport and the city center. The nearest stop to the university is [Compans Caffarelli](https://www.tisseo.fr/calculateur/?back_route=0&start_stop=Aeroport+P0+%28BLAGNAC%29&start_stop_id=poi%3A613512&start_stop_xy=&end_stop=Compans-Caffarelli+%28TOULOUSE%29&end_stop_id=stop_area%3ASA_1072&end_stop_xy=&schedule_date=2024-06-18&datetime_represents=departure&hour=11&minutes=05&metro=y&tramway=y&aerial_tram=y&bus=y&navette_aero=y&profile_list=fast&with_disruptions=y). There is a special fare for young people (around 3 Euros for the transfer from the airport to the city center).

In any case, if you are too loaded down, there are [taxi companies](https://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/en/transports/taxis). Ask them to drop you off on [Rue des Puits Creusés](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MUD2NtGWgndGkgYB8), in front of the entrance to the parking lot of the University of Toulouse Capitole.

Finally, since November 2007, Toulouse has had its own automatic bike rental system, [VélôToulouse](https://velo.toulouse.fr/), allowing you to freely use bicycles throughout your stay in Toulouse.

### Call for papers

We invite submissions to the 17th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2024). Submitted papers can present original contributions or give a summary (e.g., an extended abstract) of recent work of the authors. **There will be no proceedings for EWRL 2024.** As such, papers that have been submitted or published to other conferences or journals, or on-going work papers are also welcome. We welcome contributions on core RL topics and application papers.

Submissions are handled through Openreview. Submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee in a **double-blind** procedure. Final decisions will be taken by the program chairs based on the reviews. There will be no author/reviewer discussion phase. **Only accepted papers will be publicly released**, while rejected or withdrawn manuscripts will be kept confidential.

Submitted papers should follow the NeurIPS template adapted for EWRL linked below. There is a limit of 9 pages, excluding references and appendix. Authors of accepted papers will be allowed an additional page to prepare the camera-ready version. All accepted papers will be presented as posters.
