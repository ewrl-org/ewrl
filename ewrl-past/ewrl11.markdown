# EWRL11 (2013) | European Workshops on Reinforcement Learning
The 11th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2013)
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Dates: August 04 − August 09, 2013**  
**Location: Dagstuhl, Germany  
Post-Workshop Proceedings.**

EWRL11 will be a **[Dagstuhl Seminar](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13321 "Dagstuhl page")!  
**This original format for EWRL will no doubt lead to original ideas and fruitful discussions. Read more on the [EWRL Dagstuhl Seminar page](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13321).

Download the [detailed schedule](http://www.dagstuhl.de/schedules/13321.pdf).

Please note that meal break times are tight.

Monday 4th will start with a **self-introduction of the participants.** You have roughly **1.5 min to state who you are, what you are interested in, and maybe what you will talk about** at the workshop. The purpose is to make yourself and your interests/expertise known to the group so that people can approach you more easily.  
_Note that there are more than 40 participants, which means that 3min/participant would already be too much time._  
In this respect, if you intend to use slides, **please send us in advance a PDF of no more than 3 slides** so that we can compile all slides into one file (and don’t need to switch files between introductions).

The list of participants can be found [here](http://www.dagstuhl.de/program/calendar/partlist/?semnr=13321&SUOG).

### Tutorials and invited talks

*   **Scott Sanner:** _Symbolic Dynamic Programming_
*   **Peter Sunehag:** _Exploration/exploitation_
*   **Mohammad Ghavamzadeh** and **Alessandro Lazaric:** _Statistical Learning Theory in Reinforcement Learning and Approximate Dynamic Programming_
*   **Marcus Hutter:** _Universal RL_
*   **Joëlle Pineau:** _POMDP_

All tutorials are 45min long + 15min for questions.

Oral presentations
------------------

Oral presentations are 15min long, with ample time for questions and discussions.  
Talks should avoid conference-like reports on past work, and focus on encouraging discussion, raising new questions and interesting ideas.

In addition to presentations for accepted abstracts, we also welcome proposals for oral presentations (10min) for impromptu talks. However, we cannot ensure everyone will have a slot. Participants are encouraged to upload their talk [here](http://www.dagstuhl.de/13321/Materials/).

Paper Submission
----------------

We are calling for extended abstracts from the entire RL spectrum, may it be for a tutorial, an overview of a topic, the presentation of a novel idea or of recent results or for raising interesting problems or important RL points to be discussed, for either a talk or a poster.

Abstracts must be 2 pages long and must be formatted according to the [CoRR formatting guidelines](http://arxiv.org/corr/latexhelp "Link zu http://arxiv.org/corr/latexhelp") and the general [arXiv formatting guidelines](http://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex "Link zu http://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex"). If you are using LaTeX, simply use the default header:  
`\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}`  
The PDF is to be submitted through [EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ewrl11) (and not to the arXiv or CoRR websites) starting from now and **before May 10, 2013**.

**Important note:** Dagstuhl seminars are on invitation only. This means that if there is no space and the paper is not accepted, then unfortunately participation is not possible.

Dagstuhl Reports
----------------

Schloss Dagstuhl wants to collect **half-page abstracts for each talk** we gave, whether invited, impromptu, or based on an accepted extended abstract. This helps them guarantee the quality of their institution, and thus have funding for future seminars. Note that accepted extended abstracts do need to be shortened to half a page (in case this is not possible, please contact the “laurent orseau agroparistech fr”).

To submit your abstract, [follow these instructions](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/dagstuhl-reports/info-for-authors/) (the upload page is [here](http://www.dagstuhl.de/drs/index.en.phtml?13321) but please read the instructions first). You can use the [latex template](http://www.agroparistech.fr/mmip/maths/laurent_orseau/EWRL-2013/author-template.zip).

The deadline is September 27, 2013.

Note that Dagstuhl Reports is not related to the EWRL11-2013 proceedings, which will probably be with JMLR.

JMLR
----

[JMLR](http://jmlr.org/) has kindly accepted to host a Special Topic for EWRL-2013.  
All participants can submit a paper related to the workshop.

Please follow the [author guidelines](http://jmlr.org/author-info.html) closely. In particular, you will need to include a cover letter along with your paper, without suggestions for action editors.

When you submit your paper, make sure to select “EWRL” in the drop-down list box at the bottom left corner of the page.

The deadline is December 20th, 2013.
