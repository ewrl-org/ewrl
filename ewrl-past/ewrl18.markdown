**Description**
---------------

The European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning is the gathering hub of the Reinforcement Learning research community in Europe and one of the main world-class events in RL. We plan to make the 2025 edition an exciting event for researchers worldwide, both for the presentation of top quality papers, but also as a forum for ample discussion of open problems and future research directions.

**Topics**
----------

Reinforcement learning is an active field of research which deals with the problem of sequential decision making in unknown (and often) stochastic and/or partially observable environments. Recently there has been a wealth of impressive empirical results, including those coupling Deep Learning function approximators with Reinforcement Learning algorithms, as well as significant theoretical advances. Both types of advances are of major importance and we aim to create a forum to discuss such interesting results, their applications, consequences, and research perspectives.

### Paper Submission

We invite submissions to the 18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025). There will be no proceedings for EWRL 2025. Papers may be submitted to one of two tracks:  
1\. Regular track: unpublished work. Papers submitted to this track are unpublished, though they may be concurrently under review at another venue. These papers will be subjected to the full review process.  
2\. Fast track: published work. Papers that are already accepted at one of the venues listed below may be submitted to this track. They will not receive new reviews, but will be checked for relevance to the topics of interest to EWRL.

Submissions are handled through OpenReview. Submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee in a double-blind procedure. Final decisions will be taken by the program chairs based on the reviews. There will be no author/reviewer discussion phase. Only accepted papers will be publicly released, while rejected or withdrawn manuscripts will be kept confidential.

Submitted papers should follow the EWRL template linked below. There is a limit of 9 pages, excluding references and appendix. Authors of accepted papers will be allowed an additional page to prepare the camera-ready version. All accepted papers will be presented as posters.

For any questions, please contact the organizers at ewrl2025@gmail.com.

### Fast track instructions

For submission to the fast track, we consider papers accepted at the following venues:  
NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, RLC, AAAI, IJCAI, AISTATS, COLT, UAI, ALT, ICRA, IROS, CoRL, TMLR, JMLR, RAL. If you want to submit a paper that was accepted at a different archival venue and you believe that this venue should be included in the list above, please let us know.  
In the submission process, you will be required to provide a link to the online proceedings page showing your accepted article. If your paper is accepted but not yet published online, please send the acceptance confirmation to us at ewrl2025@gmail.com.
