### **Description**

The 15th European workshop on reinforcement learning (EWRL 2022) invites reinforcement learning researchers to participate in the revival of this world class event. We plan to make this an exciting event for researchers worldwide, not only for the presentation of top quality papers, but also as a forum for ample discussion of open problems and future research directions.

Reinforcement learning is an active field of research which deals with the problem of sequential decision making in unknown (and often) stochastic and/or partially observable environments. Recently there has been a wealth of both impressive empirical results, as well as significant theoretical advances. Both types of advances are of significant importance and we would like to create a forum to discuss such interesting results.

The workshop will cover a range of sub-topics including (but not limited to):

*   MDPs and Dynamic Programming
*   Temporal Difference Methods
*   Policy Optimization
*   Model-based RL and Planning
*   Exploration in RL
*   Offline RL
*   Unsupervised and Intrinsically Motivated RL
*   Representation Learning in RL
*   Lifelong and Non-stationary RL
*   Hierarchical RL
*   Partially observable RL
*   Multi-agent RL
*   Multi-objective RL
*   Transfer and Meta RL
*   Deep RL
*   Imitation Learning and Inverse RL
*   Risk-sensitive and robust RL
*   Theoretical aspects of RL
*   Applications and Real-life RL

### Paper Submission

We invite submissions for the 15th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2022) from the entire reinforcement learning spectrum. The papers can present new work or give a summary of recent work of the author(s). **There will be no proceedings of EWRL15.** As such, papers that are intended for or have been submitted to other conferences or journals are also welcome. Submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee in a **double-blind** procedure.

Submissions should follow the JMLR format adapted for EWRL linked below. There is a limit of 9 pages, excluding acknowledgments, references, and appendix. Authors of accepted papers will be allowed an additional page to prepare the camera-ready version. All accepted papers will be considered for the poster sessions. Outstanding papers will also be considered for a 20 minutes oral presentation.

Please send your inquiries by email to the organizers at [ewrl2022@gmail.com](mailto:ewrl2022@gmail.com).

EWRL2022 takes place in [Milan, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan). The precise address is:

> _****Aula De Carli – Politecnico di Milano – Campus Bovisa****_
> 
> _Via Candiani, 72 – 20158 – Milano (MI) – Italy_

### Reaching the Venue

Milan is very easy to travel to by car, train or airplane. The easiest way to reach Milan is by train, with many daily trains reaching the stations of Milano Centrale, Milano Porta Garibaldi or Milano Cadorna. By airplane, the best airports for reaching the workshop venue are Milano Malpensa or Milano Linate. You can also come via the Orio al Serio (Bergamo) Airport. After having reached Milan by train or airplane, to reach the Workshop venue you can chose the following options:

*   If you are in Milano Malpensa Airport, you can take the Malpensa Express Train, directly from the airport every 30 mins. The train will have final destination either Milano Cadorna, or Milano Centrale but in both cases will stop in the station of Milano Bovisa Politecnico, where the workshop will take place. So we suggest not to take the train to the final destination, but rather stop directly in Milano Bovisa Politecnico. Milan can also be reached by bus departing from Malpensa Airport. In this case you will reach Milano Centrale train station (in around 1 hour). From Milano Centrale, you can take every train passing from local train lines S1, S2 or S13.
*   If you reach Milan in Milano Linate Airport, you will first need to reach a train station either by Taxi or by bus number 73. The easiest station to reach is Milano centrale by taking bus 73 at the airport and then switching to bus 91. Once you reach a train station, you can take every train passing from the local train lines S1, S2 or S13, as they will stop in Milano Bovisa Politecnico train station. These buses and trains are easily accessible with a regular single use ATM metro ticket.
*   If you reach Milan in the Orio al Serio (Bergamo) Airport, sadly no railway connection to Milan is available. Nevertheless, you can take a Taxi or better yet a bus from the airport directly to Milano Centrale. The bus can be taken directly at the airport exit, it is available every 20-30 minutes and it reaches Milano Centrale Station in 50-60 minutes. From Milano Centrale, you can take every train passing from local train lines S1, S2 or S13 to reach the Milano Bovisa Politecnico train station.
*   If you reach Milano by train and you do not pass from Milano Bovisa Politecnico train station before reaching your final destination, the easiest way to the workshop venue is to take any train passing from local train lines S1, S2 or S13.
