Workshop Venue
--------------

[![](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/vub.jpeg?w=1024)](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/vub.jpeg)

EWRL16 is hosted at the campus of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in the heart of Brussels, the beautiful capital of Europe. The exact address is: Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Elsene in Building I and you can find a maps marker at [this link](https://goo.gl/maps/XL9oUZbYM6SXgcEe8). The building itself may not show up on the map as it is fairly new.

Reaching the Venue
------------------

Brussels is well-connected and can be reached by car, train or aeroplane. The main airport is Brussels Airport located in the city of Zaventem, just outside of Brussels. Attendees who fly into this airport have the convenient option of taking a train directly inside the airport to the 3 main train stations Brussels Nord, Brussels Central and Brussels South (Midi), but also to Etterbeek, the station next to the VUB campus. There are also taxis and busses nearby. The low-fare airport Brussels South Charleroi Airport is located about an hour’s drive from Brussels city but you can [book a shuttle bus](https://www.flibco.com/en) in advance.

When travelling to Brussels by train, there are multiple train stops inside the city which are also connected to other public transport options such as bus, tram and metro. Most international trains stop at Brussels-Midi (Bruxelles-Midi in French). For any train travel within Belgium, we recommend checking the official [website](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en).

For attendees who plan to travel by car, we highlight that Brussels is a Low Emission Zone (LEZ). We advise you to [check in advance whether your vehicle is allowed](https://lez.brussels/mytax/en/).

The workshop will be held on the [VUB campus in Etterbeek inside building I](https://goo.gl/maps/XL9oUZbYM6SXgcEe8). The campus is easily accessible using public transport. There is a train stop next to the university called “Etterbeek Station” and there are multiple bus and tram stops on all sides of the campus. There is also a metro stop “Petillon” approximately 10 minutes walking from the campus. All public transport operated in Brussels by the MIVB offers contactless payment with credit/debit card inside the vehicle. You can also buy a Brupass ticket for multiple rides. Google Maps is well integrated with the public transport schedule, making it easy to plan your trips in advance.

Note that the VUB has two locations in Brussels, with the other one being in Jette. Please make sure you come to Etterbeek as Jette is on the opposite side of Brussels. For more details and a complete campus plan, please see the official [webpage](https://www.vub.be/en/about-vub/faculties-institutes-and-campuses/our-campuses/vub-main-campus-brussels/directions).

Accommodations
--------------

We are aware of other events happening at the same time as the workshop, so we recommend booking accommodations as soon as possible. We suggest looking on platforms such as [booking.com](http://booking.com/) or Airbnb.
